# AirGuardian AI

AirGuardian AI is a citizen-level environmental health intelligence system designed to convert AQI data into personalized exposure risk and actionable mitigation strategies.

## Problem
Urban citizens are exposed to rising air pollution levels, but most platforms only provide numerical AQI values without translating them into personal health risk or mitigation guidance.

## Solution
AirGuardian AI:
- Converts AQI into personalized exposure risk scores
- Analyzes micro-zone locality indicators
- Simulates tree-based mitigation impact
- Provides relocation decision intelligence

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Gradio
- Matplotlib
- OpenWeather Air Pollution API

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install gradio matplotlib numpy requests
2. Run:
   python app.py

## Future Scope
- Satellite-based pollution mapping
- Machine learning forecasting
- Integration with municipal GIS systems
